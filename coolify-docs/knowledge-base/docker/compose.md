If you are using `Docker Compose` based deployments, you need to understand how Docker Compose works with Coolify.

In all cases the Docker Compose (`docker-compose.y[a]ml`) file is the single source of truth.

## Defining environment variables

Coolify will notice the environment variables you mention in your compose file and will display it in its UI.

```yaml
services:
  myservice:
    environment:
      - SOME_HARDCODED_VALUE=hello # Gets passed to the container but will not be visible in Coolify's UI
      - SOME_VARIABLE=${SOME_VARIABLE_IN_COOLIFY_UI} # Creates an uninitialized environment variable editable in Coolify's UI
      - SOME_DEFAULT_VARIABLE=${OTHER_NAME_IN_COOLIFY:-hello} # Creates an environment variable of value "hello" editable in Coolify's UI
```

## Coolify's magic environment variables

Additionally, Coolify can generate some dynamic environment variables for you.
The syntax is `SERVICE_<TYPE>_<IDENTIFIER>`.
Type may be one of:

- **FQDN**: This will [generate](/docs/knowledge-base/server/introduction#wildcard-domain) an FQDN for the service. The example below shows how you can add paths and ports.
- **URL**: Generates an URL based on the FQDN you have defined.
- **USER**: Generates a random string using `Str::random(16)`. You might want to use it as a username in your service.
- **PASSWORD**: Generates a password using `Str::password(symbols: false)`. Use `PASSWORD_64` to generate a 64 bit long password with `Str::password(length: 64, symbols: false)`.
- **BASE64**: Generates a random string using `Str::random(32)`. For longer strings, use `BASE64_64` or `BASE64_128`.
- **REALBASE64**: Encodes a randomly generated string using `base64_encode(Str::random(32))`. For longer strings, use `REALBASE64_64` or `REALBASE64_128`.

Every generated variable can be reused and will always have the same value for every service.
All generated variables are displayed in Coolify's UI for environment variables and can be edited there (except FQDN and URl).

As an example, imagine an application with UUID `vgsco4o` (generated by Coolify on creation).
It uses a compose file deploying Appwrite on the [wildcard](/docs/knowledge-base/server/introduction#wildcard-domain) domain `http://example.com` .

```yaml
services:
  appwrite:
    environment:
      # http://appwrite-vgsco4o.example.com/v1/realtime
      - SERVICE_FQDN_APPWRITE=/v1/realtime
      # _APP_URL will have the FQDN because SERVICE_FQDN_APPWRITE is just a simple environment variable
      - _APP_URL=$SERVICE_FQDN_APPWRITE
      # http://appwrite-vgsco4o.example.com/ will be proxied to port 3000
      - SERVICE_FQDN_APPWRITE_3000
      # http://api-vgsco4o.example.com/api will be proxied to port 2000
      - SERVICE_FQDN_API_2000=/api
      # Coolify generates password and injects it as SERVICE_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD into the container
      - SERVICE_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD=${SERVICE_PASSWORD_APPWRITE}
  not-appwrite:
    environment:
      # Same value as in Appwrite service
      - APPWRITE_PASSWORD=${SERVICE_PASSWORD_APPWRITE}
      # As SERVICE_FQDN_API is not the same as SERVICE_FQDN_APPWRITE
      # Coolify will generate a new FQDN
      # http://not-appwrite-vgsco4o.example.com/api
      - SERVICE_FQDN_API=/api
```

## Storage

You can predefine storage normally in your compose file, but there are a few extra options that you can set to tell Coolify what to do with the storage.

### Create an empty directory

```yaml
# Predefine directories with host binding
services:
  filebrowser:
    image: filebrowser/filebrowser:latest
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./srv
        target: /srv
        is_directory: true # This will tell Coolify to create the directory (this is not available in a normal docker-compose)
```

### Create a file with content

Here you can see how to add a file with content and a dynamic value that is coming from an environment variable.

```yaml
services:
  filebrowser:
    image: filebrowser/filebrowser:latest
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./srv/99-roles.sql
        target: /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init-scripts/99-roles.sql
        content: |
          -- NOTE: change to your own passwords for production environments
           \set pgpass `echo "$POSTGRES_PASSWORD"`

           ALTER USER authenticator WITH PASSWORD :'pgpass';
           ALTER USER pgbouncer WITH PASSWORD :'pgpass';
```

## Exclude from healthchecks

If you have a service that you do not want to be part of your overall healthchecks, you can exclude it from the healthchecks by setting the `exclude_from_hc` option to `true`.

<Aside type="tip">
  This is useful for example if you have a migration service that runs only once
  and then the container stops.
</Aside>

```yaml
services:
  some-service:
    exclude_from_hc: true
    ...
```

## Connect to Predefined Networks

By default, each compose stack is deployed to a separate network, with the name of your resource uuid. This will allow to each service in your stack to communicate with each other.

But in some cases, you would like to communicate with other resources in your account. For example, you would like to connect your application to a database, which is deployed in another stack.

To do this you need to enable `Connect to Predefined Network` option on your `Service Stack` page, but this will make the internal Docker DNS not work as expected.

Here is an example. You have a stack with a `postgres` database and a `laravel` application. Coolify will rename your `postgres` stack to `postgres-<uuid>` and your `laravel` stack to `laravel-<uuid>` to prevent name collisions.

If you set `Connect to Predefined Network` option on your `laravel` stack, your `laravel` application will be able to connect to your `postgres` database, but you need to use the `postgres-<uuid>` as your database host.

## Raw Docker Compose Deployment

You can set with docker compose build pack to deploy your compose file directly without most of Coolify's magic. It is called `Raw Compose Deployment`.

<Aside type="tip">
  This is for advanced users. If you are not familiar with Docker Compose, we do
  not recommend this method.
</Aside>

### Labels

Coolify will still add the following labels (if they are not set) to your application:

```yaml
labels:
  - coolify.managed=true
  - coolify.applicationId=5
  - coolify.type=application
```

To use Coolify's Proxy (Traefik), you need to set the following labels to your application:

```yaml
labels:
  - traefik.enable=true
  - 'traefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.rule=Host(`coolify.io`) && PathPrefix(`/`)'
  - traefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.entryPoints=http
```
